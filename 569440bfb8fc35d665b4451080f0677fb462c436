      "message": "There is no documentation for this as far as I know. At least I\u0027m not aware of it.\n\nThe logic here is a replication of what is currently implemented in CCUI (which in fact was created when working on multiple bugs that something was not shown in UI due to UI filtering).\n\nThere is a ticket to fix this behavior on the backend, where UI will receive only the objects it suppose to see https://contrail-jws.atlassian.net/browse/CEM-15054. But that ticket targets the R2008 release.\n\nAs for the `is_shared` property, it kind of works like `global access`, when it\u0027s marked an entity is visible across all projects.\n\nThis was also the case in the previous implementation.",
